# cc-pool Development Guide

Full style guide: [STYLEGUIDE.md](STYLEGUIDE.md)

## Project Basics

cc-pool (`ccp`) pools several Claude Max/Pro subscriptions and launches each Claude Code session on the emptiest account. Go, macOS-only, single binary.

- **Build**: `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build ./cmd/cc-pool` (pure-Go default; `-tags fuse` needs cgo + fuse-t)
- **Test**: `go test ./...` — must pass with no network, no Keychain, no daemon
- **Vet**: `go vet ./...` before every commit

## Releasing

Releases are **tag-triggered** — there is no version file to edit. `Version`/`Commit` in
`internal/version` default to `dev` locally and are injected at build time via `-ldflags`.

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which (1) builds universal
(arm64+amd64) binaries on macOS — both the pure-Go default and the `-tags fuse` variant, (2)
creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes + tarballs, and (3) auto-bumps
`Formula/cc-pool.rb` (download urls + both sha256s) on `main`. **Never hand-edit the formula
version/shas** — the `bump-formula` job owns them. A tag containing `-` (e.g. `v1.2.3-rc.1`)
publishes assets but skips the formula bump (prerelease).

Versioning is semver: `feat` → minor, `fix`/`chore`/`refactor` → patch. Latest released version:
`git tag --sort=-creatordate | head`.

This repo is **colocated jj + git**. To cut a release once the change is committed (jj manages
bookmarks; tags go through plain `git`):

```sh
jj bookmark set main -r <change>     # move main to the release commit
jj git push -b main                  # push main (fast-forward)
git tag vX.Y.Z <commit-sha>          # tag the release commit
git push origin vX.Y.Z               # push tag → triggers release.yml
```

Two filesystem trees, never confused:

- `~/.claude` — canonical Claude Code config dir. **NEVER moved, modified structurally, or registered as a pool account.** It is plain `claude`'s home and the shared overlay base; plain `claude` must keep working untouched.
- `~/.cc-pool/` — cc-pool's own state (sqlite db, daemon socket, logs) plus `accounts/acct-NN` pool config dirs (ids start at 1).

Safety rules baked into the architecture — do not regress them:

1. **The pool NEVER reads, writes, deletes, or even names the canonical unsuffixed Keychain item (`Claude Code-credentials`), and never mutates plain claude's OAuth state.** There is no exception: `keychain.ServiceName` always emits a hash-suffixed name, and no code path can name the canonical item. Every pool account — including the user's main subscription — gets its own config dir, its own refresh-token chain (from its own `claude /login`), and its own suffixed Keychain item. This is why there is no credential "adoption": forking a pool account off plain claude's login would require spending plain claude's single-use refresh token, which rotation invalidates — signing plain claude out. A fresh login per account is the only safe path.
2. **No secrets in SQLite** — the macOS Keychain is the sole secret store.
3. **Account dir strings are hashed for Keychain service names** — the path string `ccp` emits and the string hashed must stay byte-identical. No realpath/normalization divergence.

Known follow-up (documented, test-pinned in `TestConcurrentPrepareAddIndexRace`): two concurrent `ccp add`s can be handed the same account index because no row exists until FinalizeAdd; fixing it needs a pending-row reservation.

## Ask Before Assuming

When a request is ambiguous — unclear scope, multiple plausible interpretations, undefined edge cases — stop and ask. Propose 2–4 concrete options, or list the assumptions you'd otherwise make. One wrong implementation costs more than ten clarifying exchanges.

## Code Review Response (Plan Re-Entry)

When the user reviews your code and re-enters plan mode (inline diff comments, a numbered list of issues, or other review-shaped feedback):

1. **Draft a new plan**, not a code change — re-entry means "align on what you'll do next."
2. **Inline every comment verbatim** with an anchor (`#N`, file:line). Never paraphrase; the user must see each comment reproduced exactly.
3. **Cluster into themes when >5 comments**, and extrapolate each rule to other call sites with the same problem.
4. **Map every comment** in a final table: `# | file:line | verbatim | cluster`. No comment silently dropped.
5. **Don't implement before approval.**

If the user responds to a plan with questions, answer conversationally and surface choices via AskUserQuestion — don't bake answers into the plan before they choose.

## Parallelize Independent Work

Sequential is the exception, not the default. Two steps that don't consume each other's output run at the same time; when unsure whether they're independent, assume they are and fan out. The orchestrator routes and synthesizes — it never executes work a subagent could. Pick the surface by scale:

- **Batch tool calls in one message** — the cheapest parallelism and the most missed. Independent reads, greps, globs, and read-only Bash go in a *single* message, never one per turn.
- **Parallel subagent calls in one message** — ad-hoc independent investigations: "explore X while I check Y", multi-file reviews, independent edits. One message, N `Agent` tool uses, results gathered in parallel.
- **Dynamic workflow** — default for substantive multi-step work; the script holds the loop, branching, and intermediate results. See CLAUDE.md `## Plan Execution & Orchestration`.
- **Named team** — long-running peers needing agent-to-agent handoffs mid-run, via `TeamCreate`.

Single-step exception: one task, no parallel sibling, no follow-on → one subagent call is fine.

## Code Search

`semble` is wired up via `.mcp.json` (project-scoped MCP server, runs via `uvx` — nothing to install). It's the default tool for any "find code by intent or symbol" question:

1. **"How do we do X?" / "Where is the code that does Y?"** → `semble.search("...")`
2. **"Where is `Foo` defined?"** → `semble.search("Foo")` (or `search("type Foo")` for a relevance boost)
3. **"Show me other code like this"** → `semble.find_related` on a prior hit
4. **Cross-repo lookup** → pass an `https://...git` URL as `repo`

`repo` defaults to the current project root for local searches. Semble is purely semantic — it ranks by meaning, not substring, so it won't find literal strings that don't appear in nearby code.

Reach for the **LSP** when the answer must be *exhaustive* or *structural*: `findReferences`/`incomingCalls` for "who calls X", `goToImplementation` for "what implements interface I", `hover` for types.

Reach for **`Grep`** only for material neither tool indexes: literal *content* of strings/comments (error messages, env-var names, Keychain service names, TODOs) and non-source files (plists, JSON, logs). File-pattern questions go through `Glob`.

## Style Rules (summary — see STYLEGUIDE.md)

- **Fail fast, fail loud.** No silent fallbacks, sentinels, or defensive coding. No back-compat shims — delete dead code.
- **Errors**: wrap once per layer with `%w`; sentinels + `errors.Is/As`; never log-and-return; fallible call adjacent to its `if err != nil`.
- **Comments**: godoc on every exported symbol; inside bodies only TODOs, non-obvious workarounds/invariants, disabled code.
- **Flat over nested**: early returns; nesting >3 is a smell.
- **Concurrency**: `ctx` first param; every goroutine has a defined exit; locks never held across I/O.
- **Tests must catch bugs**: strong assertions, table-driven with named cases, mock externals only, negative tests required, never degrade a test to make it pass.
- **Leave it better**: fix guide violations in code you're touching; stay in scope otherwise.

## Mechanical Linting

`gofmt` and `go vet` own formatting and mechanical issues. Don't hand-flag them in review; only fix issues requiring judgment — logic, architecture, edge cases.
