// DeepProbeWithin, the bounded full read the mount-holder runs through the
// kernel mount to detect a partially wedged mirror. It compiles in every build
// variant so the daemon and CLI can errors.Is against probe verdicts that
// crossed a process boundary.

// above that and span many NFS READ RPCs; small reads provably succeed on a
// wedged mirror and would report it healthy.
