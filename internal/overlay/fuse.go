// Package overlay's fuse provider: an in-process passthrough MIRROR of
// ~/.claude mounted at an account dir via fuse-t (kext-less, NFS-over-loopback,
// mounted as the user without root). A single backing dir means writes pass
// straight through to ~/.claude and are shared live — no copy-up.
//
// cgofuse drives fuse-t natively (it dlopens /usr/local/lib/libfuse-t.dylib).
// Build with: CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -tags fuse ./...
//
// Mounts are hosted in-process and block while serving, so the daemon owns
// their lifecycle (it calls Setup at startup and Teardown at shutdown). A
// short-lived CLI invocation cannot host a mount; for those, detection falls
// back to symlink until the daemon establishes the mount.
