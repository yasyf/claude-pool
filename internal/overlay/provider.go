// Package overlay makes a pool account dir present the live contents of
// ~/.claude with writes shared straight back, so a pooled session sees the same
// projects/skills/settings as plain `claude`. Two interchangeable providers:
//
//   - symlink (default + always-available fallback): symlink each top-level
//     entry of ~/.claude into the account dir.
//   - fuse (preferred when fuse-t is installed; built with -tags fuse): an
//     in-process passthrough mirror mounted via fuse-t.
//
// Both yield the same observable result. A small set of entries is held back
// from sharing because they are instance-local runtime state that would
// conflict across concurrent sessions; see ExcludedEntries and PrivateEntry.
// Held-back files stay per-account, but .claude.json's shareable top-level
// keys (everything outside ClaudeJSONPrivateKeys) still propagate: one-way
// base→account at launch under symlink (pool.MergeBaseClaudeJSON), two-way
// under fuse (live merged read view plus shareable-key write-through to
// ~/.claude.json).

// merge, pool.MergeBaseClaudeJSON; fuse: live merged view with shareable keys
// written through to ~/.claude.json). Plus .credentials.json (and its

// store — the OAuth token blob it writes to $CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json when
// the macOS Keychain is unavailable (e.g. a headless SSH session). Sharing it
// would symlink plain claude's live credential into a pool account, so
// `claude /login` would adopt plain claude's login and a refresh would mutate
// it — the exact thing the pool must never do. Plus .last-update-result.json
// (claude's auto-update result, instance-local), which claude rewrites
// atomically — replacing the overlay's symlink with a real file that Sync would
// otherwise refuse to relink on every poll. Plus remote-settings.json (and its
// atomic-write temp siblings), claude's cached per-subscription settings
// fetched from claude.ai — per-account state claude writes directly into
