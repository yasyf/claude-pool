# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.1] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- The daemon no longer logs a `cannot link .../remote-settings.json` error on
  every overlay sync. claude's new `remote-settings.json` file caches
  per-subscription settings from claude.ai, so each account now keeps its own
  private copy instead of sharing one; a leftover shared link from an earlier
  version is cleaned up automatically.
- An overlay sync that hits a conflict on one entry now still repairs every
  other entry and reports all conflicts at once, instead of stopping at the
  first one.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-10

### Changed
- The generated shell alias (and docs) wrap `ccp run` instead of the
  `ccp select` compose form, so the alias always launches with the full
  environment cc-pool sets up, even as future versions add to it.

### Fixed
- Pooled sessions stamped account-anchored install paths into the shared
  `~/.claude/plugins` state, which claude's marketplace validator rejected as
  a "corrupted installLocation". cc-pool now pins the plugin root by setting
  `CLAUDE_CODE_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR=~/.claude/plugins` everywhere it launches or
  instructs a launch — `ccp run`, the `ccp add` login, and the `ccp env`
  export lines; a user-set value is respected.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- When every account is exhausted, `ccp select` and `ccp run` fall back to
  the least-bad account and print a loud billing warning to stderr naming the
  binding reset window, so extra-usage billing is never silent; `ccp env`
  prints the same warning.
- `ccp status` shows exhausted and overage `$X/$Y` badges, backed by the
  extra-usage overage block now decoded and persisted from the usage API.
- The daemon logs every selection (pick kind, score, usage, runner-up) so
  surprising picks can be audited after the fact.

### Changed
- The format of the internal usage database changed incompatibly, and
  cc-pool does not migrate old databases. If you upgraded from an earlier
  version and see database errors, delete `~/.cc-pool/pool.db*` and restart
  the daemon; it rebuilds the database from scratch. The database holds only
  regenerable cache and state, never secrets.

### Fixed
- `ccp` could launch a session on an account whose 5-hour window was 100%
  used — imminent-reset credit forgave total exhaustion and a sticky session
  pin never let go — silently billing extra-usage credits. Accounts with a
  pegged window and a pending reset are now unavailable, and the headroom
  barrier, runway, and sticky floor score raw current remaining, so an
  imminent reset can no longer mask zero headroom.
- `ccp select --wait` now actually waits instead of returning immediately.
  It refuses exhausted-pool fallback picks and keeps waiting for headroom,
  and a pick it discards while waiting no longer counts against the account.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- Account scoring forgave far too much weekly usage when the 7-day reset was
  days away — an account at 73% weekly usage with a reset ~2.5 days out could
  rank first over fresher peers. The reset-credit horizon is now capped at
  one 5-hour session, so a distant weekly reset earns no credit and accounts
  rank by true weekly headroom.
- The `ccp select`/`ccp run` heading and the `ccp status` detail panel
  labeled the reset-aware "effective" figure as `free`/`remaining` next to
  the raw `used` bars, producing contradictions like 73% used / 74% free.
  The heading now shows raw % used (health-tinted), and the panel labels its
  score term `effective` so it reconciles with the usage bars.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- `ccp add` no longer hangs silently before the login prompt: the daemon now
  answers readiness checks immediately on startup, a restart race that could
  kill the fresh daemon and start a second instance is gone, and the
  remaining startup waits show a spinner so they read as progress.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Plan-mode plans are shared across the whole pool: the overlay links each
  account's `plans` dir to the single `~/.claude/plans` store, so plans
  written in one pooled session are visible from every account and from
  plain `claude` instead of being scattered per account.

## [0.12.4] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- `ccp add` no longer mistakes plain claude's startup-adopted session secret
  for a completed login. Over headless SSH, `claude /login` copies the global
  session secret into the account's credential store before any login
  happens; the add watcher treated that copy as "login done", killed claude
  mid-menu, and registered a duplicate of the main subscription. Completion
  is now gated on the account's own `.claude.json` identity, and finalize
  refuses accounts without one — console/third-party API logins, which write
  no identity, are rejected: cc-pool pools Max/Pro OAuth subscriptions only.

## [0.12.3] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- Upgrading no longer prints a `pkill -f 'cc-pool daemon'` instruction when
  an old daemon is slow to release the socket: `ccp` now evicts the stale
  daemon itself, asking launchd first and, for a true orphan, stopping only
  the exact process holding `~/.cc-pool/daemon.sock`, never anything matched
  by name.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- The shared overlay no longer links or mirrors `~/.claude/.credentials.json`
  into pool account dirs. claude writes its OAuth credential to that
  plaintext file when the macOS Keychain is unavailable (e.g. a headless SSH
  session), and sharing it meant `ccp add` ran `claude /login` against plain
  claude's live credential — adopting that login instead of prompting for a
  new account, and mutating plain claude's credential on refresh, the one
  thing the pool must never touch. Each account now keeps its own.
- Credentials resolve Keychain-first with a plaintext-file fallback, so the
  login watcher, add finalization, the daemon's idle token refresh, and
  `ccp doctor` work whether claude stored the credential in the Keychain or
  in `.credentials.json` — headless setups no longer break the Keychain-only
  assumptions.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- The daemon no longer logs a relink error on every overlay sync poll:
  claude rewrites `.last-update-result.json` atomically, replacing the
  overlay's symlink with a real file that sync refused to relink. The
  auto-update result is now a private per-account entry — it stays
  instance-local and never lands in the shared `~/.claude` base.
- Starting the daemon via brew (`ccp service install`) now makes sure it is
  actually running: `brew services start` only loads the launchd job, and a
  stop/start race could leave it loaded but never executing.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Rate-limit reset windows show as absolute local times — `3:58 PM`,
  `tomorrow 3:58 PM`, `Tue 3:58 PM`, `Jun 15, 3:58 PM` — instead of relative
  durations like `Resets 45h50m`, across the `ccp status` table, the TUI
  5h/7d rows, and the `ccp select` waiting-until lines.

### Fixed
- The daemon converges to the installed version after an upgrade. Previously,
  when an orphaned old-version daemon held the socket but launchd no longer
  tracked it, the new daemon refused to bind and `ccp status` restarted the
  daemon on every run without converging. A starting daemon now evicts a
  version-skewed holder (refusing to bind only against a genuine same-version
  peer), and `ccp` asks the old daemon to step down before restarting it.
  Along the way: an exiting daemon can no longer delete its successor's
  socket, health checks respond immediately on boot even while fuse mounts
  are still coming up, and fuse unmounts can no longer hang shutdown.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- `ccp run` and `ccp select` name the chosen account and show its effective
  5-hour / 7-day headroom instead of a generic "Selected the emptiest
  account" line; an account the daemon has never sampled degrades to a
  name-only line.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Bare `ccp` invocations that lead with a claude flag (e.g. `ccp --resume`,
  `ccp -p "hi"`) forward to `ccp run` instead of failing with "unknown
  flag". `ccp`'s own `-h`/`--help` and `-v`/`--version`, its subcommands,
  bare `ccp`, and unknown-command suggestions all behave as before.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- `ccp status` no longer mislabels stale accounts as "no-data": the daemon
  reports whether usage data actually exists instead of inferring it from
  staleness, so an account whose poll is merely overdue keeps showing its
  real utilization.
- Accounts no longer read "stale" for most of every poll cycle: the
  staleness label used a 90-second threshold against a ~3-minute poll
  interval, and now allows 5 minutes before flagging an account.
- `ccp status`, `ccp select`, and `ccp run` detect and reject a daemon left
  running from a previous version instead of rendering garbage; the status
  TUI restarts the skewed daemon automatically.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Renamed the short command from `clp` to `ccp` (the symlink beside the
  `cc-pool` binary), along with all help/error text, shell-alias generation,
  and docs. Everything named `cc-pool` is unchanged — the binary, Go module,
  Homebrew formula, launchd label, FUSE volname, and the `~/.cc-pool` state
  dir — so account dirs, Keychain service names, and stored state need no
  migration.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- `ccp run` is a transparent launcher: it replaces itself with `claude` via
  exec instead of supervising a subprocess, so once claude starts cc-pool is
  gone from the process tree and signals, the controlling terminal, and the
  exit code are all claude's. Arguments pass through verbatim with no `--`
  separator needed (e.g. `ccp run --resume`).
- `ccp run` picks its account the same way `ccp select` does — taking the
  daemon's reserved pick and falling back to a live selection only when the
  daemon is unreachable — and the daemon keeps the chosen account's token
  fresh in the background.

### Removed
- The `--account` flag on `ccp run`, which cannot coexist with literal
  argument passthrough; force a specific account with `CCP_ACCOUNT=<id>`
  instead.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Interactive `ccp status` TUI: a live-refreshing account list plus a detail
  pane that explains the selected account's score factor by factor, with a
  footer legend. Piped or non-TTY output falls back to the plain table with a
  one-line legend; `--plain` forces the table on a terminal.

### Changed
- Status 5h/7d columns show % used (100% = exhausted), matching Anthropic's
  framing, with usage bars; the `SESS` column is renamed `LIVE`, and flags
  appear inline only when present.
- `ccp select` is quieter: it names the chosen account instead of printing a
  generic reuse line, and prints only when stdout is a terminal — silent
  under pipes and command substitution.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed
- Two processes refreshing the same account's token at once — the daemon's
  poll loop racing a short-lived `ccp` invocation — could double-spend the
  single-use OAuth refresh token, leaving the loser with `invalid_grant` and
  the account revoked until an interactive re-login. Token refresh is now
  serialized across processes with a per-account lock held over the whole
  read–refresh–write cycle; a waiter that acquires the lock after a peer
  already rotated the token re-reads the fresh credential instead of spending
  its own refresh.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- `ccp add` no longer ends silently: it prints the canonical launch command
  and offers to wrap `claude` so plain `claude` routes through the emptiest
  account, forwarding all arguments. The wrapper is idempotent, never
  clobbers a user-defined `claude`, `-y` consents, and `--no-alias` opts out.
- `ccp add` detects when a login is the same subscription already in the pool
  (by accountUuid) and, on a TTY, asks before adding it again; non-interactive
  runs warn and proceed so automation is never blocked.

### Changed
- Trimmed the add flow to what you can act on: internal setup chatter and
  the redundant "closed claude" line are gone. "Add another account?" now
  defaults to yes after the first account, and the closing line just reports
  the pool total.

### Fixed
- Usage headroom was inflated 100x: the `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint reports
  each window's `utilization` as a percent (0–100), but the client treated it
  as a 0..1 fraction, so `ccp status` showed nonsense like -2600% headroom
  and negative scores. The value is now read verbatim, and the usage
  model matches the current API shape (the stored-but-never-scored seven-day
  Opus window is dropped).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-08

### Changed
- Reworked the CLI output: a shared styled output layer with consistent,
  flush-left formatting and a single huh form theme. Human flows (`add`,
  `status`, `select`, `run`) no longer leak internal ids, Keychain service
  names, paths, or overlay kind; those stay in the inspection commands
  (`ccp list`, `ccp doctor`). Copy across every command rewritten for clarity.

### Removed
- Credential adoption. `ccp add` no longer copies plain claude's current login
  into a pool account. Adopting meant refreshing plain claude's single-use
  OAuth refresh token, which rotation invalidated — silently logging plain
  claude out. Every account now logs in with its own `claude /login`, so plain
  claude's token is never read or spent; no code path in cc-pool can even
  name plain claude's Keychain item anymore.

### Fixed
- Usage decode crashed when the API returned `resets_at` as a string. The field
  now accepts a JSON number, a numeric string, or an RFC3339 timestamp.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- Bare `ccp` routes by pool state: an empty or uninitialized pool on a
  terminal runs the add flow, a populated pool shows status, and an empty
  pool without a terminal errors loudly.
- Credential adoption in `ccp add`: when plain claude's current login isn't
  pooled yet, offer to copy its credential (read-only) into the new account's
  own Keychain item and refresh the copy onto its own token chain — no new
  login (removed again in 0.5.0; see above).
- Watched login: `ccp add` owns the `claude /login` it spawns and closes it
  for you once the credential lands, with full terminal restoration; the
  manual other-terminal path polls with a spinner. Account labels prefill
  from the logged-in email.

### Changed
- `ccp remove --keep-credential` followed by a re-add no longer resurrects
  the kept credential, and `ccp add -y` no longer prompts for a label.

### Fixed
- A usage-validation blip during the final add step keeps the registered
  account with a warning instead of offering a rollback that destroyed a
  live credential.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added
- `ccp add` — pool a Claude Max/Pro subscription (interactive `claude /login`),
  each account in its own `~/.cc-pool/accounts/acct-NN` config dir with its own
  independent OAuth grant and Keychain credential. Auto-initializes the pool
  and starts the background daemon on first run; loops to onboard several
  subscriptions in one go. Plain `claude` on `~/.claude` is never part of the
  pool and can never be logged out by it.
- New account dirs are seeded from `~/.claude.json` (top-level `oauthAccount`
  stripped; `claude /login` writes the account's own), so pooled sessions
  inherit settings, MCP servers, and per-project tool approvals instead of
  hitting the first-run onboarding wizard.
- `ccp select` — print the emptiest account's config dir, scored from live
  5-hour / 7-day usage with imminent-reset credit, low-headroom barrier, and
  burn-rate terms; cwd-keyed session stickiness for prompt-cache continuity.
- `ccp run` / `ccp status` / `ccp list` / `ccp env` / `ccp doctor` /
  `ccp remove` — session lifecycle, live usage table, account inspection,
  drift repair, and account removal.
- Shared overlay so every account presents all of `~/.claude`: symlink
  provider (default, pure Go) and optional fuse-t live mirror (`-tags fuse`).
  Per-account private entries: `daemon/`, `ide/`, `backups/`, and
  `.claude.json`.
- User LaunchAgent daemon (`ccp service`, `brew services`): usage polling with
  backoff, idle-account token refresh, score caching, fuse mount lifecycle.
  `ccp add`/`ccp init` start it automatically and restart it after upgrades.
- `ccp init` — optional explicit pool setup (state dir + daemon); `ccp add`
  does the same automatically.
- Homebrew formula with `ccp` symlink (prebuilt universal binary; fuse build
  picked automatically when fuse-t is present); CI and release workflows.
